# About

This blog is dedicated to the exploration of my experiences with and understanding of programming and data science. The purpose of launching a blog is threefold:

- To act as a place to gather my thoughts and formally reflect on articles, books, conferences, courses and so on that relate to both of the themes of this blog
- To plug a hole in the contemporary blogscape with discussions of approaches, libraries and concepts relating to the major themes of this blog that I find to have been missing
- To profile and explain my personal projects
