# About

This blog is dedicated to the exploration of my experiences with and understanding of all things related to programming and data science. The purpose of launching this blog is threefold:

- To act as a place to formally reflect on articles, books, conferences, courses and so on that relate to the major themes of this blog
- To plug a hole in the contemporary blogscape with discussions of approaches, libraries and concepts relating to the major themes of this blog that I find to have been missing
- To profile and explain my personal projects
